 Cube Level Editor :

An application Design interface that would help Game designers build levels.

	- Each level consists of several chunks.
	- Chunks are built on Grids.
	- Grids are basic platforms that bring Designers schemes into orders that could fit in eachother.
	- Grids can be nested. which means one grid can be fitted into another.
	- The whole level itself is build on a huge grid, which name is the "Main Grid".

	- Level Behaviors*
		- HUD*

	- Each chunk contains several objects that are either animated or solid. They are as written below:
		- Basic Tiles that would build the skeleton of a chunk.
		- Triggers that enable actions in specific location of a level (that would be in the current chunk or others).
		-  Collectables
		-



	- Tiles are either animated or solid.
	- Tiles animation are either coded or Baked by artists.

	- Tiles Canvas width and height can be  either resizable or fixed.
		- in case of resizable, tiles canvas would turn into a local grid, then the tile with the fixed size will fit in it, together they build the object.
		- in case of fixed size, tiles canvas would be a square that the specific tile would fit in.

	# chunks desgin would be tile based. Designers build chunks with several tiles that are available within the Editor.
	# Tiles width and height sizes are powers of 2, Therefor with this design Grids can perfectly fit within eachother in case of nested grids.
